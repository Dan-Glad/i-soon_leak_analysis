Their contract ledger has a lot of records from other equivalent firms looking to purchase i-Soon's tools or offer mutual cooperation. Nevertheless, an investigation hasn't been done to clearly determine the exact mutual cooperation circle of i-Soon, and perhaps the Chinese state itself. Some more research into this direction could uncover the specific abilities of Chinese national cybersecurity firms and the overall cyber power of China when it comes to the international cyber ecosystem.\n",

    "#### 2. How is i-Soon's chain of command structured, and who are its prominent operatives?\n",
    "There are a lot of leaked chatlogs and screenshots with identifiable information of some of the people working for i-Soon. At the moment it is clear that i-Soon operates within a roughly hierarchical structure, with certain characters having a higher role, such as \"Mr. C\". By further analyzing the data, it is possible to reconstruct the exact organization of the company, which can give a deeper insight into how decisions are made internally, how various tasks are handled, who are the higher-ups who make the final calls, and any other identifiable information that can clarify i-Soon's extensive network of partnerships in the national cyber market.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. How has i-Soon's modus operandi been adapting to the global cybersecurity trends, investigations and remedies?\n",
    "i-Soon's leaked product manuals and internal discussions give a clear view on what capabilities the company has, and which vulnerabilities were i-Soon's employees inclined to exploit. However since the cyber landscape is always evolving, i-Soon must have needed to revise their methods of achieving their targets. By tracking how it was adapting to rapid developments in order to continue operating and keeping their CNNVD partnership level, further perception of i-Soon's strategies can be observed. More specifically, how i-Soon managed to counter and adapt to the countermeasures in the timespan of the leaked data, which can also be used to predict i-Soon's current methods and ways of keeping afloat past the leaks."
